Explaination of Assigment 2
In this example, we assume you have a dataset stored in a CSV file (dataset.csv). The code uses the pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame (df).

The z-score method is then applied to each column of the dataset using zscore from the scipy.stats module. The z-score measures how many standard deviations a particular data point is away from the mean of the distribution.

A threshold is set to determine which values are considered outliers. In this case, any value with a z-score greater than the threshold of 3 is considered an outlier.

The np.where function is used to find the indices of the outliers based on the z-scores. These indices are then used to locate the corresponding values in the DataFrame (df.iloc[row, column]).

Finally, the code prints the indices and values of the identified outliers. You can modify this part to suit your needs, such as performing further analysis or applying specific actions on the outliers.

Keep in mind that the z-score method is just one approach for outlier detection, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the nature of your dataset. Other methods, such as the interquartile range (IQR) or machine learning algorithms, can also be utilized depending on the specific requirements of your analysis.
